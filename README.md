How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I focus on clear naming, modular design, and reusability. The CRUD Python module made the dashboard easier to maintain and could be reused for other MongoDB projects.



How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I break the requirements into smaller pieces, like database queries, dashboard layout, and interactivity. This project required more client-focused thinking compared to past assignments, and I would use similar step-by-step strategies for future databases.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve problems by turning data into useful tools. My dashboard work helps a company like Grazioso Salvare quickly identify the right rescue dogs, making their operations more efficient and effective.
